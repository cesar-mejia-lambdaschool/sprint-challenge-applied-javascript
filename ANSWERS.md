### Questions:

- What is the DOM?
  - The DOM stands for the Document Object Model. The browser takes our HTML code and parses it to create the DOM. The DOM can be further manipulate with JavaScript to add, remove and modify DOM Elements. In addition, we can use JavaScript and the DOM API to add EventListeners to DOM Elements to make our page dynamic to user input.
- What is an event?
  - A DOM event is a signal broadcasted by the browser window object that some action or occurences has taken place in the DOM, which we can optionally choose to automicatically response to with an event handler.
- What is an event listener?
  - A DOM EventListener is method attached to Node Elements with the .addEventSelector method. The EventListerner requires two arguments, a case-sensitive string that defines the event the Node Element will respond to, and a callback function that triggers when the event is detected by the appropriate Node.
- Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
  - We would convert a NodeList to an Array to gain access to the Array.prototype methods like .map, .reduce, etc.
- What is a component?
  - A component is a DOM Element given similar functionality by the use of JavaScript Class syntax (syntaxtic-sugar on pseudo-classical prototypical inheritance)
